"""PRACTICE EXERCISE-1
Imagine you're developing a library management system. In this system, all items are cataloged as either physical books or ebooks. While both share common attributes like title and author, ebooks also have a file size attribute.

Task
Complete the Ebook class definition by properly initializing it to include the additional file_size attribute. Ensure that instances of Ebook inherit the title and author attributes from the Book class and also add the file_size attribute specific to ebooks.
